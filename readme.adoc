= C to Python Translator

== Running
The translator is currently only accessible through the link:https://github.com/erlang/rebar3/[rebar3] shell. To access this, run `rebar3 shell` in the root directory, and to translate a c program to python run `gen_server:call(translator, {translate, "<C CODE>"}).`.


== TODO
- Finish adding for loops and the rest of the assignment operators
